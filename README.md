# Saturn Homework

We have a client who wants a Saturn webpage! They've given us an image for desktop and one for mobile view:

- [📱 Mobile](./specs/saturn-mobile.jpg)
- [🖥 Desktop](./specs/saturn-desktop.jpg)

You've been given the HTML for the Saturn page and a starter stylesheet. Your task is to add to the stylesheet so the page in the browser looks like the specs and find an image for the quote section.

## Required Reading
- [Eloquent Javascript chapter 13](http://eloquentjavascript.net/13_dom.html)
- [css-tricks media queries](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/)
- [mozilla media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) 

## Before you start: 

- Take some time to read through the CSS. What rules are doing what? What happens if you change a few things? 
- You'll notice that the CSS is commented pretty heavily. Use it as a roadmap for where to write your declarations!
- Write for mobile first! You should only have a couple of rules in the desktop section.

## Deliverables

- Remember your [homework work flow](https://git.generalassemb.ly/nyc-wdi-hypatia/hypatia-students/blob/master/hw-workflow.md)
- Your issue ticket should contain a link to a deployed page on github pages and a link to your repo.
- Our logo right now is super boring 😕 Try creating a new one **without using any images or image editors** and then animate it! Just spitballing here but we did something that looked an awful lot like an orbiting planet in class today...
- If applicable, your repo should have the bonus reflection markdown file (see bonuses below)

## Bonuses! 🎉

### 🚨🚨🚨 Please, please, please *DON'T* complete all of these!!! 🚨🚨🚨

They're designed so that you should only be able to do one or *at most* two. ***Remember to get some sleep!***

- In this repository, create a markdown file `reflection-properties.md` (❗️this also should be linked in your issue ticket) and write about: 
    - Your two favorite CSS properties so far
    - The two properties that are giving you the most trouble
- Make another planet page! (You *should* be able to reuse a lot of the HTML from the Saturn page and just change the content.)
- Don't like the design? Switch up the [colors](http://www.vanschneider.com/colors/) and [fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
