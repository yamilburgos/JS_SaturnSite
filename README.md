# Saturn Homework

We have a client who wants a Saturn webpage! They've given us an image for desktop and one for mobile view:

- [📱 Mobile](./specs/saturn-mobile.jpg)
- [🖥 Desktop](./specs/saturn-desktop.jpg)

You've been given the HTML for the Saturn page and a starter stylesheet. Your task is to add to the stylesheet so the page in the browser looks like the specs and find an image for the quote section.

## Before you start: 

- Take some time to read through the CSS. What rules are doing what? What happens if you change a few things? 
- You'll notice that the CSS is commented pretty heavily. Use it as a roadmap for where to write your declarations!
- Write for mobile first! You should only have a couple of rules in the desktop section.

## Your submission should:

- Follow the issue ticket template
- Have a link to your Saturn homework repo
- If applicable, have a link to your bonus reflection (see below)
- Have a short paragraph (2-3 sentences) describing which bonus you chose to do, why you decided to do it, and (if applicable) what bugs or issues you ran into as you were working on it.

## Bonuses! 🎉

### 🚨🚨🚨 Please, please, please *DON'T* complete all of these!!! 🚨🚨🚨

They're designed so that you should only be able to do one or *at most* two. ***Remember to get some sleep!***

- In this repository, create a markdown file `reflection-properties.md` (❗️this also should be linked in your issue ticket) and write about: 
    - Your two favorite CSS properties so far
    - The two properties that are giving you the most trouble
- We have the desktop and phone views of our site locked down but what about tablet rules? Add a few!
- Make another planet page! (You *should* be able to reuse a lot of the HTML from the Saturn page and just change the content.)
- Don't like the design? Switch up the [colors](http://www.vanschneider.com/colors/) and [fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- Our logo right now is super boring 😕 Try creating a new one **without using any images or image editors**. Here's a hint: What happens if you set `border-radius: 100%` on a `div` with a height, width, and background color? Add your logo to both the header and the footer.
- If you're super proud of your work & want to show it off, try uploading it to GitHub Pages!
